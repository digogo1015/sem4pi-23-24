# US G005

## 1. Context

*This task is being taken for the first time in this Sprint.*

## 2. Requirements

**US G005** As Project Manager, I want the team to add to the project the necessary scripts, so that
build/executions/deployments/... can be executed effortlessly

**References:**

*Include scripts for all the major tasks and execution of applications*

## 3. Observations

*As of this moment there isn't yet any necessary execution of applications whatsoever, but the scripts given in the
project work and already do what is necessary.*
