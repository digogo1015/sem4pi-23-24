# US G001

## 1. Context

*This task is being taken for the first time in this Sprint.*

## 2. Requirements

**US G001** As Project Manager, I want the team to follow the technical constraints and concerns of the project.

**References:**

*Regarding this task we understand that it relates to the constraints and concerns described in Section 3.2 of the
project description.*

* NFR01 - Programming language The solution should be implemented using Java as the main language. Other languages can
  be used in accordance with more specific requirements.
* NFR02 - Technical Documentation Project documentation should be always available on the project repository ("docs"
  folder, markdown format) and, when applicable, in accordance to the UML notation. The development process of every
  US (e.g.: analysis, design, testing, etc.) must be reported (as part of the documentation).
* NFR03 - Test-driven development The team should develop a relevant set of automated tests for every US / Class /
  Method. The team should aim to adopt a test-driven development approach.
* NFR04 - Source Control The source code of the solution as well as all the documentation and related artifacts should
  be versioned in a GitHub repository to be provided to the students. Only the main (master/main) branch will be used (
  e.g., as a source for releases)
* NFR05 - Continuous Integration The Github repository will provide night builds with publishing of results and metrics.
* NFR06 - Deployment and Scripts The repository should include the necessary scripts to build and deploy the solution in
  a variety of systems (at least Linux and Windows). It should also include a readme.md file in the root folder
  explaining how to build, deploy and execute the solution.
* NFR07 - Database By configuration, the system must support that data persistence is done either "in memory" or in a
  relational database (RDB). Although in-memory database solutions can be used during development and
  testing, the solution must include a final deployment where a persistent relational database is used. The system
  should have the ability to initialize some default data.
* NFR08 - Authentication and Authorization The system must support and apply authentication and authorization for all
  its users and functionalities.
* NFR09(LPROG) - Requirement specification and Interview Models The support for this functionality must follow
  specific technical requirements, specified in LPROG. The ANTLR tool should be used (https://www.antlr.org/).
* NFR10(RCOMP) Functionalities related to the Candidate and Customer Apps and to the Follow Up Server part of the
  system have very specific technical requirements. It must follow a client-server architecture, where a client
  application is used to access a server. Communications between these two components must follow specific protocol
  described in a document from RCOMP ("Application Protocol"). Also, the client applications can not access the
  relational database, they can only access the server application.
* NFR11(RCOMP) The solution should be deployed using several network nodes. It is expected that, at least, the
  relational database server and the Follow Up Server be deployed in nodes di erent from localhost, preferably in
  the cloud. The e-mail notification tasks must be executed in background by the Follow Up Server.
* NFR12(SCOMP) The base solution for the upload of files must be implemented following specific technical requirements
  such as the use of the C programming language with processes, signals and pipes. specific requirements will be
  provided in SCOMP.
* NFR13(SCOMP) An alternative solution for the upload of files must be implemented following specific technical
  requirements such as the use of the C programming language with shared memory and semaphores. specific requirements
  will be provided in SCOMP.
* NFR14(SCOMP) The process to count words of very large files should follow specific technical requirements such as
  implementing parallelism and concurrency using Java and threads. specific requirements will be provided in SCOMP.
* NFR15(LAPR4) This project has some specific requirements regarding communication and presentation of the project
  and its results. This is a concern of the project and its related to the presentations for the sprint reviews in
  the context of the LAPR4 TP classes(i.e., skills module). LAPR4 will provide further specification for this
  requirement.

## 3. Integration/Demonstration

*Although in Sprint one there are no USs that need to take the requirements into considerations, some such as NFR02 are
being taken into account in the production of the documentation.*

## 4. Observations

*All the requirements described in the Section 3.2 of the project description will be taken into account in the
implementation of future USs*
